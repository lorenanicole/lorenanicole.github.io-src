Title: Akwaaba! A Pan-African Python Conference and The Year of Return

Recently I returned from my first trip to West Africa visiting Lagos, Nigeria and Accra, Ghana. 

In preparation for the trip, I had to obtain not one but two visas. In previous travels I've been able to obtain a visa at the airport, such as for my Cuba visit in 2016, when it was temporarily permitted for US Citizens to travel to Cuba.

Speaking with colleagues, many were surprised, some not so much. Those not surprised overwhelmingly were those that hold citizenship status in other countries.

Acquiring the two visas, one which required me to travel to New York City to submit my biometrics for a tourist visa, in hindsight was a perfect prelude to my travel to West Africa. The privilege of not needing to consider what paperwork was needed prior to entry is a rare one and one I have been accustomed to. Time and time again I would be reminded of my privilege and how that informs the way I navigate the world.

### A Pan-African Python Conference: PyCon Africa

First, thanks where thanks are due. If it weren't for [Marlene Mhangami](https://twitter.com/marlene_zw), a fellow Director of the Python Software Foundation, who also served as Chair for the inaugural [PyCon Africa](https://africa.pycon.org/) I would not have attended PyCon Africa. It was Marlene who informed me, "you know, Accra and Lagos are about an hour flight apart" as my initials plans only included Lagos for a friend‚Äôs birthday celebration. (Please watch this 23 questions with Marlene video below, it's amazing!)

Most of the [PyCon Africa organizing team](https://africa.pycon.org/team/) is the same team behind [PyCon Ghana](https://twitter.com/pyconghana?lang=en). These folks helped organize transport for international travelers to/from airport as well as coordinate countless details on the ground. Shout out to [Noah Alorwu](https://twitter.com/plasmadray) who graciously picked me up from the Accra airport and dealt with the eccentricities of a person who has barely slept after ~ 14 hours of travel by plane!

Kicking off with a day tour of Accra for international travelers and workshops like Django Girls, the core conference began on Thursday August 8th. I arrived just in time from Lagos for the end of the opening keynote by [Moustapha Cisse](https://twitter.com/Moustapha_6C), lead of Accra's Google AI team. Cisse's keynote set a theme that'd continue to emerge for the rest of the conference: how can technology be used to solve African problems by African technologists? 

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello!!!

Moustapha's keynote expanded into an impromptu "ask me anything" session where the audience asked Moustapha questions for half the time and Moustapha asked the audience questions for the remainder. One telling question arose when Moustapha, whose work focuses on fairness, transparency and reliability in machine learning, was asked, "What problems do we confront [in machine learning] given the numerous amount of languages in Africa?". Earlier Moustapha in his keynote indicated that the lack of data in local languages has been a barrier in creating machine learning solutions that work adequately for Africa.

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are 2,000+ languages in Africa. It‚Äôs the most linguistically diverse place in the world. Machine learning is being used to help reduce the linguistic barriers. <br><br>Moustapha Cisse, Head of Google AI Center Accra, is dropping knowledge!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConAfrica?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PyConAfrica</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KojoInACC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KojoInACC</a></p>&mdash; Kojo Idrissa @ Home #NorAmGT (@Transition) <a href="https://twitter.com/Transition/status/1159415836085374976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

Moustapha responded that, "it's not a problem, but a wealth" to have such an abundance of African languages adding that, "access to information is not unique to Africa but it true for the entire world". Commenting that there are two approaches to solving NLP problems like language detection, Moustapha highlighted how using deep learning, in lieu of statistical ML solutions that rely on human translation and language expertise, is a promising approach. When solving African problems, the focus should not be on deficiencies but on the wealth of the African community. "I myself am a failed physicist so I went to ML as it was simpler", Cessi joked while asking the audience to consider "what triggered your curiosity to pursue the path into technology?".  

Over the next two days several speakers continued to reiterate forms of this question, inspiring the audience to think creatively about what they can do for their communities. [Felipe de Morais](https://twitter.com/felipedemorais_)' talk on AfroPython, a Brasilian community he helps organize, explored this idea deeper, focusing on the role of diaspora for Afro-Brasilians. At one point, raising the challenge that, "[you do not have to be Black to help Black people](https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/1159438676486758402?s=20)". The [African tech panel](https://twitter.com/bright_morkli/status/1159506152784310276?s=20) also challenged everyone to consider what it means to build a sustainable African tech economy.

All of this future facing discussion culminated with [Kojo Idrissa](https://twitter.com/transition)'s emotionally powerful keynote that reflected on lessons from the past. Beginning with how his name is based on the famous Maroon leader [Cudjoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cudjoe) to the simple truth that he has returned to Africa,  "Because my cousins has invited me home" both to PyCon Africa and through [The Year of Return](http://yearofreturn.com), Kojo spelled out how the legacy of the African diaspora has had an impact on us all, regardless of where one lives. It is up to us to choose how we will learn from it. For Kojo, he has chosen empathy to help build a more inclusive Python and by extension technical community.

### The Year of Return: Using the past to inform the future

2019 marks the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in Jamestown, Virginia. To commemorate this anniversary, moving the narrative to one of Homecoming, the Ghana government kicked off 2019 as the [Year of Return](https://www.yearofreturn.com/about/). 

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lest we never forget those countless Africans that lost their lives, their name, their identity, their right to be seen and treated as humans. üá¨üá≠ <a href="https://t.co/Km3ZozXePe">pic.twitter.com/Km3ZozXePe</a></p>&mdash; Loooorena üêØ &quot;La Tigresa&quot; üêØ Mesa @ The Cosmos üí´ (@loooorenanicole) <a href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/1160589904054751234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center> 

Nigeria at approximately 200 million people is the most populous African country with [42.54% of the population under 14](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html). Training centers like Andela that are ‚Äúharder to get into than Harvard‚Äù (in 2016 they received [23,400 applications and only had a 0.6% acceptance rate](https://andela.com/insights/year-look-past-12-months/)!) combined with other bold initiatives like [Data Science Nigeria‚Äôs](datasciencenigeria.org) effort to ‚Äúraising 1 million AI talents in 10 years‚Äù are but a small reflection of the vast untapped talent in Africa. 

The many people I met at PyCon Africa (and in my trip in general), from Benin to Zimbabwe, shared a valuable lesson: it isn‚Äôt the past that dictates the future but how we use that past to build the future. 

How will the world engage with the African tech community? How will those within Africa engage with one another? And ultimately, how can we all as Pythonistas or generally speaking as technologists do better? Time will tell, but already change is in the air and I for one am excited for the future. Oh and you should go to PyCon Africa 2020, I know I'll be there!
