This week marks the 100th year anniversary of the 19th Amendment in the United States of America.

For *only* 100 years, women (and to be clear not *all* women, because, history, and that's a topic for another post) whom were citizens in the United States of America gained the right to vote:

>> The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

Only fitting that Michelle Obama should sport a `VOTE` necklace during her empassioned virtual Democratic National Convention address last night. (Also, yes, I did order a knockoff `VOTE` necklace, this one [donating $5 USD to the League of Women Voters NYC](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/the-vote-necklace).)

## Voting during COVID19

Voting in a normal year is always fraught with issues, from disinterest and apathy to the normal run of the mill attack on civil liberties. However, add in 2020 and we are seeing an entire new threshold of issues:

- the very real physical danger of voting in person due to the novel coronavirus
- baseless and malicious attacks from [Trump and his campaign alleging mailin voting is illegal](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/trump-nevada-mail-voting-lawsuit-390878)
- [the precarious fiscial situation of the United States Postal Service](https://news.wttw.com/2020/08/16/pelosi-call-house-back-session-vote-usps-bill)
- social media tech giants unwillingness (or at leasts low response) [to tackle "fake news" and conspiracy theories](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/technology/google-facebook-coalition-us-election.html)
- the overall relentless attacks against vulnerable communities, but particularly POC communities, ranging from being [the most vulernable to COVID19](https://www.wbez.org/stories/a-perfect-storm-50-lives-and-4-zip-codes-tell-chicagos-story-of-covid-19-inequality/50b822ae-523e-47fa-a823-3c6a1c3ee12f) to police brutality to food and [rent insecurity](https://www.housingstudies.org/blog/Examining-the-Neighborhood-Level-Impact-of-COVID/)

Collectively, these challenges add an even finer point to why voting matter -- _if we don't show up, what else will we lose?_ 

## Making a voting plan

It is *exhausting* and *overwhelming* to discuss things in 2020. 

But, you are not alone. We all are here. Trying to figure out how to move forward.

One way we can move forward towards Election 2020 is to prepare, plan, and be ready. 

Details [vary state to state](https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vote-state-by-state-guide-voting-by-mail-early-in-person-voting-election/) and states are scrambling to clarify what date a mail in ballot [can be accepted](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/13/889751095/signed-sealed-undelivered-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-rejected-for-tardiness).

So, how are you planning to vote? 

If you don't have an answer, don't worry. That's why we are going to [prepare a voting plan](https://www.ncjw.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Create-a-Voting-Plan.pdf).

In 2016, of the more than 120 million votes cast only [some 107,000 votes in three states effectively decided the election](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/swing-state-margins/). This math is beyond problematic. Why we continue to have an electoral college which disproportionately gives states with less population more voting power (cough: Senate) [is an oddity in the simplest of terms](https://www.sceneonradio.org/episode-31-turning-the-lens-seeing-white-part-1/). In order to take on strucutral inequities, we need to take action to install a competent Executive body that believes, in no particular order: the value of *all* but particularly those whom have suffered harm so unjustly for so long, science, truth, decency, and above all *in us*. 

So, let's make this voting plan.

Here's three questions I want you answer for yourself.

1. How will you vote?
2. How will you confirm you have voted?
3. If that fails, what will your backup be?

Some of y'all already answered me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Registered! Got the receipt and know all my voting location and mail-in ballot drop-offs. Everyone should check their registrations as well as know their voting locations.</p>&mdash; mrcartoonster üá∫üá∏üáµüá∑ (@mrcartoonster) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrcartoonster/status/1295559663493107712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just confirmed my voting registration and mailing address. Also got text alerts setup so I know when my ballot is mailed to me and received. I plan to take my ballot to a local drop site üëçüèª</p>&mdash; RedBear (@gizm0_0) <a href="https://twitter.com/gizm0_0/status/1295560853593264128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

And here's where I need your help. It's not enough to plan only for yourself. You need to find ways to hold yourself accountable. As well as others in your circles.

Steps I've taken:

1. Confirmed I'm registered by mail to vote
2. Confirmed I have PTO for November 3 2020
3. Confirmed where my nearest voting precict is in the case my ballot is late

## You've got homework

Go and ask five folks in your network. That's your homework. Do it. If not for me, then for Michelle Obama.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My voting plan, in so many words, as wordsmithed by a colleague named Kevin. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DNC2020convention?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DNC2020convention</a> <a href="https://t.co/CAEZ3Ujvds">pic.twitter.com/CAEZ3Ujvds</a></p>&mdash; Loooorena &quot;La Tigresa&quot; Mesa @ #BlackLivesMatter üñ§ (@loooorenanicole) <a href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/1295561304007233536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

[She deserves better](https://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21373174/michelle-obama-dnc-speech-trump). I do. And yes, so do you.
