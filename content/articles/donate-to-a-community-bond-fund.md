👋🏽,

It's been a minute ⌚ since I wrote. 

We *all* are taking life day by day. Hour by hour.

However, the last 36 hours have been some of the most ... extreme. While I write this I hear the helicopters overhead, the honking down the block, the news in the background defaming my beautiful Chicago.

There's so many emotions I know we have:

- We are angry. 
- We are lusting for a life before COVID19. 
- We want to be back together.

I cannot, as a light skinned person of Latinx heritage, justify sitting by on the sidelines while there are those that tell us *we should not care*, that *we should do nothing*.

If you are not ANGRY at the  murder of George Floyd, at the countless black lives lost before, and what is likely to be the continued callous murders of our black brothers and sisters. I do not know what to say to you. 

If you are not ANGRY at your brown brother and sisters, mainly from Latin America, locked in cages and treated inhumanly. I do not know what to say to you.


If you are not ANGRY at billionaires getting richer while millions of USA people lose their jobs and income. I do not know what to say to you.

Step up, be present, be critical. Most importantly, to my white people, listen. Listen, do something, **DO BETTER, BE BETTER**. 

Here is a way to start 👇🏽

- [DONATE MONEY TO THE CHICAGO COMMUNITY BOND FUND](https://chicagobond.org/donate/). 
- Donate [to your all the bond funds](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd) through this campaign. 


🖖🏽, & 🐍, 

Lore is out.
