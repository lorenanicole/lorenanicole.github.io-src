Title: Values
Summary: Values 
Slug: values

### Why values matter

This isn't meant as an empty promise towards diversity, inclusion, and belonging. Rather by stating plainly and unapologetically my values I can provide a platform for myself, and ideally others, to consider how they can participate as ethically minded, inclusive technologists in today's world. 

1. First and foremost, I value a diverse yet inclusive technology community. Perhaps as it was best stated to me as: _diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance_.

2. I uphold the [Global Data Ethics Pledge](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/ethics-resources#global-data-ethics-pledge-gdep). By extension, I am unconditionally an advocate for and practicioneer of data ethics.

3. Self-care is a cornerstone to any successful career and practice. This includes self-care for mental health and physical well being.

4. Empathy and active listening go hand in hand. Be empathetic to yourself, your team, your users. We can demonstrate this in many ways, but one critical way is through active listening.

5. Failure is a normal and expected reality. Failure is just another way to say, "I tried [and learned]".

6. Education is never done, it is always ongoing. We can learn by teaching, practicing, immersing ourselves into new spaces, reading, and more. Find what works for you and do it.

### Do these things matter to you?

If so, great! If not, we all have different values and motivational drivers. Discovering those will help you identify what projects you want to pursue and how you want to impact change around you.

### Value driven tech

My values inspire the type of tech I build and the communities I participate in. Projects and communities that I'm actively supporting and/or participating include:

- _Data ethics and transparency in data science and machine learning_: [Global Data Ethics Pledge](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/ethics-resources#global-data-ethics-pledge-gdep)

- _Diversity and Inclusion building in Chicago_:[Chi Tech Diversity Initiative](http://chitechdiversity.com)

- _Immigration reform_: [Mijente](https://mijente.net/)

- _Data for Black Lives_: [Data for Black Lives](http://d4bl.org/) is one way to support the platform originated by #BlackLivesMatter.

- _Open Source_: Specically in Python through the [Python Software Foundation](https://python.org/psf) as a contributing member and member of various PSF workgroups by building a globally diverse, inclusive Python community and supporting Python open source software.

- _Ethically minded researcher and technologist_: I'm always available to consult on projects that may be data heavy, require data science expertise, or need a technologist willing to donate services for a non-profit / civic cause.
