# I am passionate about speaking because I believe that each of us can leave more than we take. As a public speaker I aim to raise awareness, motivate, and ultimately introduce you to something new.

###_Who I am as a speaker._

Community engagement and curiosity have greatly empowered me as a technologist. Through exploration and contributing/using open source I have developed a knack for deconstructing complex topics. That's actually what inspired my first technical talk. 

While speaking on the latest and greatest in tech may be exciting, that's not why I speak. I speak to inspire others to try something new. Speaking also allows me to give back to the open source community. Energy and curiosity are defining traits of me as a speaker. Additionally my talks often employ a lens of accessibility by focusing on the technical content rather than the acrynonyms and buzz words surrounding the topic.

As an educator and etc (e.g. building diverse practices) consultant, I've taught and worked with many diverse populations. Therefore I won't participate in events that lack a [Code of Conduct](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq). I frequently teach workshops (often of my own creation) at [PyLadies Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-PyLadies/events/253170166/) and often speak at home grown, community conferences. Curious in seeing some of my talks? Many are archived at [PyVideo](https://pyvideo.org/speaker/lorena-mesa.html) and various slides from my talks can be found on my [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/lorenanicole). Additionally my talking history can be found [here](/talks.html).

- Civic tech
- Learning to code
- Leveling up as a coder and/or technologist

###_Where am I speaking next and what's my availability._ 

My next confirmed speaking commitment is as a keynote at [PyCon Spain](https://2018.es.pycon.org/) in October 2018. Conferences more than 100 miles away from Chicago, Illinois I'm open to speaking at starting January 2019.

I am available to speak in English, y sí español también. Hablo español, pero por favor dime si quieres una charla en español. Todavía necesito practicar.

###_What you can expect from me._

I tote my own equipment - that is a MacBook Pro. I often employ a slide stack using Google Slides. If you require additional equipment, please communicate that in your request. 

More questions or have a propose in mind? Please drop me a [line](mailto:me@lorenamesa.com?subject=Speaking+Inquiry), I'd love to chat!

###_Therefore, what can I expect from you._

An animated and throughly researched talk, well prepared with slides available for review well before the conference (as defined by the speaker agreement)!

Preparing a talk involves hours of preparation including research, writing, and countless hours of etc work. If you are from a for profit conference depending on the speaking opportunity you inquire about that can impact the speaking honorarium/fee. At the minimum, travel and lodging accommodations are expected. Not sure what you can support? Reach [out](mailto:me@lorenamesa.com?subject=Speaking+Inquiry)! For community conferences I am happy to discuss financial support as well. 

Workshops, in short, require payment and depend on the length of workshop required and more.
